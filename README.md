work-item-repo since version 6.0.0 uses the latest ReactiveMongo (https://github.com/ReactiveMongo/ReactiveMongo) instead of HMRC fork of it (https://github.com/hmrc/ReactiveMongo). Please review your dependencies if you upgrade. In particular you should no longer use https://github.com/hmrc/Play-ReactiveMongo/ in your microservice.
